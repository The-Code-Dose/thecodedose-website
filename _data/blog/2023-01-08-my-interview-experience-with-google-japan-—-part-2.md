I recently interviewed with Google for a University Grad role based in Tokyo, Japan in October. After passing my phone screen, I was invited to interview onsite in Bangalore. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed because I was hoping to visit the Tokyo office for the onsite but unfortunately that didn’t happen.

The interview consisted of 5 rounds — 45 minutes each. After the first three interviews, there was lunch where I was accompanied by a Software Engineer working at Google. 1 round was a Googleyness & Leadership round while the other 4 were all technical. I didn’t have a System Design interview since I was applying for a new grad position. All the technical rounds were based on my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I was supposed to write code on an editor used by Google for interviews. It had the basic functionalities such as selecting a language, code highlighting and brace completion. They provide you with the option of using the whiteboard, pen and paper, sticky notes etc.

# Round 1 — Googleyness & Leadership

This interview was surprisingly taken by a Software Engineer. He started the conversation with a simple behavioral question and built up further questions based on my responses. The entire time, he was taking notes of everything I was saying. At the end of the interview, he asked me if I had any questions for him that I wished to ask. This round was quite enjoyable, in fact it eased me out of my anxiety that I had been feeling since morning!

# **Round 2 — Technical**

This round immediately started after the first one ended. They make you sit in a meeting room where all of your interviews will take place and the interviewers will be joining you there itself. In this round, I was asked 2 questions. The first question was fairly easy and was based on Trees. I wrote the code for it in Python. The second question was based on strings. I came up with two approaches, coded both of them, but unfortunately, I couldn’t optimize it further.

# Round 3 — Technical

The Engineer for this round had declined due to some other commitments and so they had to find a replacement for me. Eventually, my next two rounds were preponed. The interviewer came in a hurry. We went ahead straight towards the question just like all the previous interviews. This question was based on Binary Trees. I did come up with a naive approach but I had to optimize it further. I got overwhelmed and confused, the interviewer gave me a lot of hints. By the end, I felt like he was the one who solved it. I did write the code at the end and did a dry run on an example but I believe I performed poorly in this round.

# Lunch

I was accompanied by a Software Engineer for lunch. We walked to the cafeteria out of the meeting room. We had about 30 minutes for the lunch. He asked how my interviews went so far. I told him about the last interview and how I totally ruined it. He said not to worry too much since we didn’t have to ace all of our interviews and he shared his own experience interviewing there.

# Round 4 — Technical

After lunch, I went back to my room. I had some time to kill by myself since the next interview wasn’t for another 45 minutes. I was again asked two questions in this round. The first one was based on strings, and it had a follow-up question. I wrote the code for both. Then the interviewer asked me to optimize it. I gave an optimized solution but he didn’t ask me to code it. Then he searched for another question to ask since we had about 15 minutes left. I gave the solution for this with the help of some hints but didn’t write any code since we didn’t have any time left.

# Round 5 — Technical

I was asked a single question in this round which had multiple follow-ups. It was based on Binary Trees again. I wrote code for the first two variations of the question. I discussed the approach for the last follow-up. The interviewer said he didn’t expect me to write code for this one.

# Result

If you would have read my previous post you would already know that I was in contact with two recruiters — X and Y. After about 10 days, I pinged Y asking for any updates. She said that the feedback was still being finalized and she will let me know of further updates. After another 15 days, I finally received a rejection saying that they decided not to move further with my application and that they cannot share further details of my result.

I was really disappointed because this entire process took about 4 months. I wanted some feedback on my performance so I emailed them again asking for my cool-off period to re-apply and feedback from the interviewers. X told me that he would be happy to get on a call and talk about it.

He told me that I received mixed reviews on my performance. My Googleyness & Leadership interview went well and they liked how I articulated my thoughts and experiences. However, two of my technical interviews received mixed reviews and two went good. So, they couldn’t make a strong case for me to the hiring committee. But I should re-apply after 10 months or so and he will try to get me directly to onsite the next time.*He also told me not to feel discouraged since it’s difficult to clear Google Interview in the first go and that I should look forward to reapplying.*

# Conclusion

I wouldn’t lie and say that I am over it. I did spend months preparing for it. I invested a lot of time and energy and therefore I am still upset about it since I received the rejection earlier today in the morning.But I didn’t want this negative energy to eat me up, therefore, I decided to write this postinstead.I learned a lot throughout the process. I would love to share about my preparation and other resources I discovered — but that’s for another time!

Also, Iam grateful for having such helpful recruiters who rooted for me and gave me amazing tips throughout these past few months.
