Do you want to learn about computer programming but don't know where to start? This beginner's guide will help you find the best resources to start coding today.

# Pick one programming language to start with.

P﻿ick a programming language and start learning the fundamentals of what makes a programming language - variables, data types, control structures, pointers, functions etc.

I﻿f you have the time and patience, start with a *statically typed language* such as C/C++ or Java. If you're in a hurry and want something easy, pick a *dynamically typed language* such as Python or JavaScript.

H﻿ere's a [flowchart](https://carlcheo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/which-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-pdf.pdf) that will help you pick your first programming language.

# Learn programming basics

It’s important to learn the fundamentals of a programming language before you dive into more advanced topics like web development or artificial intelligence etc.

Luckily for you, there are plenty of resources available online that can help you with that.
Here are some of the best websites where you can learn programming:

- [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

# Learn data structures and algorithms

Study data structures and algorithms once you know the fundamentals.
This will help you build your problem solving skills and will also help you with tech interviews.

Recommended resource:
[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-tutorial/?ref=shm)

It's important that you practice what you learn.
Here are some platforms where you can practice your problem solving skills:

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/)

# Pick a role

In order to apply for jobs, you need to pick a role that you're interested in.

[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) has roadmaps for different tech roles such as frontend developer, backend developer, blockchain developer etc and roadmaps detailing the exact skills required for each.

# B﻿uild projects

Projects are really important to practice what you learnt as well as to showcase your skills to recruiters and potential employers.

Create a [Github](https://github.com/) and learn git to host your projects on the internet for others to see.

Github has an excellent [post](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) listing the resources available to learn git and github online.

# Practice Interviewing

According to [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/), interviewing is the most profitable skill you can learn.
You can start practicing for interviews on Pramp for free!

Pramp has different interview tracks such as data structures, algorithms, system design etc to choose from as well as paid courses that help you build your interviewing skills.

# Conclusion

Do not limit yourself and don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Learning to code can be hard but you can do it :)
