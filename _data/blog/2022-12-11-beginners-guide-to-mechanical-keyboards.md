Are you thinking about buying a mechanical keyboard? Don’t know what to look for? Don’t worry, I got you covered in this post.

## W﻿hat is a mechanical keyboard?

M﻿echanical keyboards have physical switches under each key, rather than the rubber membranes used in most common keyboards (membrane keyboards).

F﻿or example, the keyboard of your laptops.

## T﻿ypes of Switches

C﻿licky switches are more audible than the others. Choose a switch on the basis of how loud you want it to be and how it feels like when pressed.

T﻿he modern switches used today were originally manufactured by the German company Cherry. After their patent expired, many other variants have been made by other companies, based on the original Cherry design.

## Hot Swappable

A﻿ keyboard being hot-swappable means the PCB (which, simply put, is the circuit board inside the keyboard) has special sockets so that you can click switches into place and pull them out without ever needing a soldering gun.

## K﻿eyboard Layout

Full-size keyboards come with the traditional modifiers, arrow keys, and numpad. Tenkeyless (TKL) like a full-size board, but without the numpad.
A compact/ 60% keyboard omits the numpad, arrow keys, and function row

## K﻿eycaps

Keycaps are typically made of one of two types of plastic: ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) or
PBT (polybutylene terephthalate).
ABS plastic keycaps become shiny with use whereas PBS plastic keycaps have a rougher texture and don't get shiny with use. They also sound a bit deeper.

## C﻿able / Bluetooth Connectivity

Some mechanical keyboards can be connected via bluetooth, others require a cable. Pick one that you prefer.

## B﻿acklighting

Some mechanical keyboards are backlit (the light underneath the keycaps). The lighting could be solid coloured or RGB that can be programmed.
