During my trip to South Korea, I spent about 5 days in Busan.
Busan is the second second most populous city after Seoul and is located in the southeastern part of South Korea.

If you're planning to visit Busan soon, here are some must do things and must visit places!

# Gamcheon Culture Village

This colorful hillside village is known for its maze-like alleys with colourful houses, painted murals, and quirky shops and cafes.
The houses appear like they are built on a staircase and hence has the nickname "Machu Picchu of Busan".
It's a popular tourist spot and a great place to take photos and soak up the local culture.

# Haedong Yonggungsa Temple

The Haedong Yonggungsa temple is also called the most beautiful temple in South Korea because of its uniqueness, it's located right on the coast on a cliff, with waves crashing on its foot, creating a picturesque view of the ocean.
It's a great place to take photos and enjoy the peaceful surroundings.

# Gwangalli Beach

Gwangalli Beach is a popular destination in Busan known for its lively atmosphere.
It is a great place to swim, sunbathe, and relax on the sand. The beach is wide and long, offering plenty of space for visitors to spread out and enjoy the beautiful views of the ocean.

You can spot the Gwangan Bridge, also known as the Diamond Bridge, a beautiful suspension bridge that spans across the ocean from the Gwangalli Beach.
At night, the bridge is lit up with colorful lights, creating a stunning sight for visitors.

# Yatch Cruise in the Busan Sea

You can indulge in the sunset or night yatch cruises along the Gwangalli Beach with closeup of the Diamond Bridge and a firecracker show to make it more memorable.

Remember to bring along a windbreaker as the winds on the ocean can get pretty cold!

# Haeundae Beach

This is Busan's most famous beach, with a long stretch of golden sand and crystal-clear water.
You can also enjoy the nighlife in Busan near the Haeundae Beach.

# Beomeosa Temple

This ancient Buddhist temple is located in the mountains above Busan, and is a great place to escape the city and enjoy some peace and quiet. The temple grounds are beautifully landscaped, and there are many hiking trails in the area.

# Gukje Market

This traditional Korean market is one of the largest in Busan, and is a great place to shop for souvenirs, clothing, and household items. You can also sample some of the local street food here.

# BIFF Square

The name "BIFF" stands for Busan International Film Festival, which is held annually in the city.
Located near the Gukje market, BIFF Square features a section of the street known as "Star Street," where famous Korean actors have left their handprints in cement. It's a great place to take photos and see some of your favorite stars' handprints.
While you're here, you can also enjoy the famous Busan Hotteok filled with seeds.

# Jagalchi Market

Busan is known for its delicious seafood dishes, such as raw fish (hoe) and seafood soup (jagalchi guksu). There are many restaurants in the Jagalchi market that specialize in these dishes, so be sure to give them a try while you're here.

# Jeonpo Cafe Street

Jeonpo Cafe Street is a popular destination in Busan for coffee lovers and foodies. Located in Jeonpo-dong, the street is lined with trendy and unique cafes, restaurants, and shops.

You can explore the different cafes and try their unique menu items, including latte art and trendy drinks like dalgona coffee.
The street is also home to many small boutique stores and shops, selling unique and handmade items. You can browse the different stores and find souvenirs, clothing, and accessories to take home.

# \[BONUS\] Gyeongju

Gyeongju is a city located in the southeastern part of South Korea, known for its rich cultural heritage and historical significance. It was once the capital of the ancient Silla Kingdom and is now a popular tourist destination.
You can take a day trip from Busan to Gyeongju as it's only a 30 minutes KTX train ride away from Busan.

# \[BONUS\] Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival

The Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival is an annual (usually in early April) festival held in Jinhae, a district in Changwon city in South Korea.
You can book a day trip from Busan to Jinhae (which is what I did) via Klook.

Yeojwacheon Stream is a popular spot during the festival, with cherry blossoms lining the banks of the stream. You can walk along the stream and take in the scenic views, as well as see the famous "Romance Bridge" and "Bridge of Freedom."

Gyeonghwa Station is a historic train station in Jinhae that is famous for its cherry blossoms. The station is located in the middle of a cherry blossom tunnel, with trees on both sides of the train tracks. You can visit the station and take photos with the cherry blossoms in the background.
