You might be wrong! You’re not lacking the motivation to code daily, what you’re lacking is willpower. Here’s what I mean…

# Motivation vs Willpower

Motivation and willpower are often confused between.
Let's dive deeper into the topic of willpower and motivation when it comes to coding.

Coding is a complex and challenging task that requires you to be disciplined, focused while putting in sustained effort consistently. Unfortunately, many people find it hard to stay motivated and consistent when it comes to coding. They may start with great enthusiasm but soon lose steam and give up especially when self learning.

One of the reasons for this lack of consistency is a misconception about motivation. People often think that they lack motivation when, in reality, they lack willpower. Motivation is the reason why you want to do something, while willpower is the force that helps you stick to your goals in the face of distractions and temptations.

Willpower is essential for achieving any long-term goal, including coding. It allows you to resist distractions, overcome procrastination, and work towards your goals even when you don't feel like it.

# Willpower is a limited resource

Willpower is not an infinite resource. It is a limited but renewable resource that you must treat as such. Every morning, you start with a 100% reserve of willpower which goes down throughout the day.

When you use your willpower to resist distractions and temptations, you're essentially using up some of that reserve. The more you resist, the emptier your tank gets, until you run out of gas. Waiting for willpower to come may lead to disastrous results.

# What the book 'The One Thing' tells us about willpower

It's crucial to use your willpower effectively and reserve it for things that matter the most to you. One of the best ways to do this is by prioritizing your goals and tasks.

The book "The One Thing" by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan emphasizes the importance of identifying your "one thing." This means identifying the most important task that will make the biggest impact on your goals and prioritizing it over other distractions.

By focusing on your one thing, you can make the most of your willpower and achieve your coding goals. Additionally, it's essential to take care of yourself by refueling your willpower during the day.

# You are what you eat

Eating foods that provide longer-lasting sources of energy, such as proteins and complex carbohydrates. By doing so, you can increase your reserve of willpower, enabling you to work towards your long-term goals.

Another way to boost your willpower is by taking breaks and engaging in activities that recharge your batteries. For example, taking a walk, doing some exercise, or meditating can help you replenish your willpower reserves.

Coding requires both motivation and willpower. While motivation is crucial for getting started, willpower is essential for staying consistent and achieving your coding goals. By understanding the nature of willpower and using it effectively, you can make progress towards becoming an accomplished coder. So, start prioritizing your goals, refuel your willpower, and watch yourself code like a pro every day!
