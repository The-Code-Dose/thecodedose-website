Searching for a job is a stressful and frustrating process, especially when you've put in a lot of effort and time into crafting the perfect application and you don't even hear back from the employer.

The waiting game can be frustrating, and it's understandable if you feel discouraged or disheartened when you don't even receive a response. However, applying through career sites or job boards means that your application has low visibility in a pool of applicants.
Here are [10 tips that you can use to craft the perfect resume](https://www.thecodedose.com/blog/10-resume-tips-you-need-to-know-before-applying-for-your-next-job) and increase your chances of getting noticed.

But opportunities are everywhere!
In this blog post, you'll find out how you can create more opportunities for yourself in tech by going beyond career sites/job boards.

# Internships / Contract Work

Doing an internship or contract job might not be what you had in your mind while looking for a full-time job.
However, if you're having no luck with hearing back from job applications, try applying for an internship or a contract position instead.
They might have a low barrier to entry than a full-time job.
Look for opportunities that have a possibility to convert into a full-time role.
If there's a company that you really love and want to work with, you can start out as an intern or contractor and work your way up!

# Past Employers / Clients

If you already have some experience in the industry, don't shy away from reaching out to past clients or employers (if you're still in good terms with them...) and let them know that you're looking for a new opportunity.

They might be kind enough to refer you somewhere if not employ you again!

# Open Source Communities

Contributing to open source projects is a great way to expand your network and building genuine connections in the industry.
This can lead to new opportunities, introductions to key individuals, and potential job offers.

Contributing to open source can be a great way to boost your job search for several reasons.
It can help you showcase your technical skills and demonstrate your ability to work collaboratively with others.
This can be particularly helpful for individuals who are looking to break into the industry or change careers.
You can build a portfolio of work that can be shared with potential employers. This can provide concrete examples of your work and the value you can bring to a company.

Sometimes, open source projects also hire contributors for full-time or contract positions!

# Writing Blogs

Let me tell you a story, a couple years ago I wrote a blog post on Medium about my Google Interview experience.
Some kind individual had happened to come across it and reached out to me to ask if I wanted to work in a Tokyo based startup.
They were willing me to refer me as well!
Even though that didn't work out in the end but I was super glad to have come across such an opportunity via a mere blog post.

Writing blogs can be a great way to increase your social presence and get noticed by potential employers.
If you write regularly, make sure to leave a note at the end of your articles to let people know that you're open for work and encourage people to reach out to you via email.

# Twitter

Where are all the tech people hanging out nowadays? You guessed right, Twitter!
Social media is huge in today's world and it's time you start leveraging the opportunities it provides.

Don't be afraid to put yourself out there!
By engaging in conversations and sharing content related to your field, you can build relationships and expand your network, which can lead to new opportunities.

A lot of employers are tweeting about open roles. Look out for such posts and message them!
Many companies use Twitter to post job openings, so following companies you're interested in and keeping an eye on their tweets can help you stay up-to-date on potential job opportunities.

# Instagram

I've received so many opportunities knock at my door only because I am actively posting tech content on Instagram.

You can use Instagram to document your journey in tech and grow an audience.
By sharing your own content, such as blog posts, projects, or opinions, you can establish yourself as a thought leader in your field and demonstrate your skills and knowledge to potential employers.

# Tech Communities

Join tech communities/slack communities of like-minded people.
Join newsletters and alumni networks.
Many tech communities have job boards or job listings that are exclusive to members of the community. By being an active member, you can gain access to these opportunities and potentially find job openings that are not advertised elsewhere.

Attend tech meetups and conferences happening around you.
By attending events, participating in online forums, and engaging in conversations with others, you can expand your network and potentially connect with individuals who can help you find job opportunities.

# Referrals

Reach out to your friends or past colleagues and ask if their employers are looking for new talent.
Ask them if they'd refer you for the same!
Even if they are not able to directly help you with your job search, it's still important to stay connected with them.
You never know when they may hear about a job opportunity that would be a good fit for you or when they may be able to offer advice or support.

But don't go around asking random people on the internet for referrals, it might not be as effective.
