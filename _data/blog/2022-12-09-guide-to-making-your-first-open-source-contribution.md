I﻿f you want to contribute to open source but don't know where to begin, then this post is for you. H﻿ere's a step-by-step guide to help you make your very first open source contribution!

## Step 1: P﻿ick a Project

I﻿f you already have a specific project in mind, then you can move on to the next step. If you don't know what project to contribute to, then you should make a list of technologies and skills you're familiar with and begin your search there.

[C﻿odeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) will help you find a GitHub project that is looking for contributors. You can filter these projects by any programming language.

A﻿lternatively, you can directly look for projects on GitHub and filter them by languages and topics.

## S﻿tep 2: Setup the Project Locally

U﻿sually, all projects will have documentation guides for new contributors. 

L﻿ook for the guide to setup the project locally to get started. Hopefully, the guide will be enough to get you setup but incase you get stuck, you should look out for the project's communication channel to seek help from other contributors.

I﻿f you can't find it, the next option would be to identify the project's maintainer and send them an email asking for the same.

I﻿f this doesn't work, then you can try your luck by creating an issue on GitHub itself. Warning: this might annoy the maintainers.

## S﻿tep 3: Read the Contributor Guidelines

I﻿f a project accepts contributions from the community, it's likely they'll have a contributor guideline present.

You must read it before you go ahead and make any contributions. The guideline will help you understand the standards and practices used in the project. For example - branch naming, commit message formats, pull request title guidelines etc.

## S﻿tep 4: Begin with Newcomer Friendly Issues

N﻿avigating new codebases can be intimidating. It's easier if you start out with smaller or more beginner friendly tasks.

T﻿o look out for those, check if the issue tracker has issues labelled with tags such as 'beginner friendly', 'newcomer friendly', 'good first bug' etc.

I﻿f not, then ask in the communication channel if there's a task that you can pick up.
