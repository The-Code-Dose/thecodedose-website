* Do not worry about figuring out the entire journey in the beginning. Figure out a starting point and just start. You can refer to roadmaps to identify where you are in your journey and where to go from there.
* Learn from other people's journeys. Seek out other self-taught developers and listen to their advice and tips.
* Try learning from different resources. Sometimes, it's good to know the different perspectives out there to form a better and complete understanding.
* There are many ways to get "real world experience" before you start a full-time job. You can get started with open source, internships and freelance work.
* Start writing a coding blog. This will serve as a proof for your experience and skills. Tutorial projects are not enough! If you don't have any project ideas, you can participate in online hackathons to find prompts and get motivated.
* Make a study plan and write down what you want to achieve everyday You can split the contents of a book/course over a period of time. Hold yourself accountable.
* Connect with like-minded people and pair program!
  Pair programming can be a way to share knowledge with each other.
