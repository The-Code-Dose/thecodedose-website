 ﻿Being vocal in the workplace is essential to communicate ideas and opinions effectively. However, it can take time to find the right balance between speaking up and being heard while avoiding conflicts and maintaining a positive work environment. In this blog, we will discuss some tips to help you be vocal in the workplace.



# **5 tips on how to be vocal in a work environment**

## **Know your value**

It is crucial to understand your worth and the value you bring to the table. This will give you the confidence to speak up and share your ideas with others.

## **Prepare**

Before attending a meeting or speaking up in a group, make sure to do your research and clearly understand the topic you will be discussing. This will help you present your ideas clearly and concisely.

## **Speak clearly and concisely**

When speaking up, make sure to speak clearly and use a confident tone. Avoid using filler words and speaking too fast, as this can make you come across as uncertain or nervous. Get straight to the point and keep your ideas short and concise. This will help others understand your perspective and ensure that your ideas are heard.

## **Find allies**

Surround yourself with colleagues who support and encourage you. Having allies in the workplace can give you the confidence to speak up and share your ideas.

## **Be persistent**

Don't give up if your concerns are not immediately addressed. Follow up and continue to advocate for your ideas and concerns.

# **How to be vocal without sounding arrogant**

## **Listen actively**

Listen to others and understand their perspectives before expressing your ideas. This will show that you respect others and are open to collaboration.

## **Use "I" statements**

Instead of using aggressive language, use "I" statements to express your opinions and ideas. For example, "I think we should consider this option because…" instead of "We should do this because…"

## **Avoid interrupting**

Interrupting others can be perceived as disrespectful and arrogant. Make sure to let others finish speaking before expressing your ideas.

## **Be open to feedback**

Be open to receiving feedback and constructive criticism. This will show that you are willing to learn and grow and help you avoid coming across as arrogant.

## **Use empathy**

Try to understand and empathise with others. This will help you build relationships and foster a positive work environment.



# W﻿ays to be vocal

Being vocal doesn't necessarily mean speaking up all the time. Here are some other ways to be vocal and express yourself in the workplace:

## Writing

You can express your ideas and opinions through writing, such as in emails, memos, or reports. This can be a less intimidating way to express yourself, especially if you are uncomfortable speaking up in a group setting.

## Body language

Your body language can also convey your thoughts and ideas, even if you are not speaking. For example, nodding, leaning forward, or making eye contact can all convey interest and engagement.

## Nonverbal cues

Nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, can also express your ideas and opinions. Pay attention to these cues when communicating with others, and be mindful of the message you are sending.

## Articulate gestures

Simple gestures, like pointing or making a writing motion with your hand, can help emphasize a point and make your message more memorable.

## Ask for time on the agenda

If you have a significant issue you want to discuss, ask to have it added to the agenda of a meeting. This gives you a designated time and platform to express yourself.
