Recently I visited the famous Jeju Island on my vacation to South Korea.
The island is often described as the Hawaii of South Korea.
Though I have never visited the real Hawaii,

Jeju is a big island which can be divided into 4 major areas: Jeju City (North), Seogwipo City (South), Aewol (North West) and Seongsan (East).

# Jeju City

If you fly into Jeju, you'll arrive in the Jeju City.

## Cherry Blossom Spots

## Yongdam Rock

Yongdam Rock is a popular volcanic rock formation that looks like a dragon's head.
You can walk around and soak in the ocean views and click pictures or sip coffee and eat cake while watching the waves crash into the rocks at Antoinnette Bakery.
