Recently I visited the Jeju Island on my vacation to South Korea.
The island is often described as the Hawaii of South Korea because of how beautiful it is!
Jeju is a big island which can be divided into 4 major areas: Jeju City (North), Seogwipo City (South), Aewol (North West) and Seongsan (East).

Since Google Maps does not really work in South Korea, I recommend you download Naver Maps.
They might get a little bit getting used to but that's probably the best option that you have!
Here's are some places that you can visit during your trip to Jeju.

# Jeju City

If you fly into Jeju, you'll arrive in the Jeju City which is very near the airport.

## Cherry Blossom Spots

If you're visiting Jeju in the cherry blossom season, then here are some cherry blossom spots that you must visit!

## Samseonghyeol

The Samseonghyeol is an archeological, historical and cultural landmark.
The shrine has an entry of 4000krw per adult and you can bring in a photographer for an extra 2000krw which is what I did!
Since, I was travelling alone, it was super hard taking photos of myself so I searched on Airbnb experiences for a photographer (I had never had a professional take my photos before :o)

If you're visiting the Jeonnong-ro Cherry Blossom Street, it's just a 20 minutes walk from there.

This is one  is one of the closest beaches to Jeju City.
It took about an hour for me to reach there using the bus.
The white sand and clear water make it the perfect spot to relax and soak up the sun.

# Seogwipo City

I found that Seogwipo City was a bit hard to travel within using the public transport as compared to Jeju City.
I was unable to visit many of the spots because of the long bus wait times.

I advise that you rent a car or book a private taxi for the day.
You can also find some group day tours on Klook.

## Camellia Hill

Camellia Hill is a beautiful botanical garden located in Seogwipo City. The garden is known for its vast collection of camellia trees, which feature over 500 different species and cultivars of camellias from around the world.

In addition to the camellias, the garden also features a variety of other plants and flowers, including azaleas, magnolias, and rhododendrons. Visitors can enjoy exploring the various walking trails and gardens, taking in the stunning views of the surrounding landscape, and learning about the history and culture of camellias.
