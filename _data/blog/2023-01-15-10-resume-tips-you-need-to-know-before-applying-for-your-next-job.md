Your resume is usually the first impression a potential employer has of you, so make it as polished and professional as possible. Unfortunately, many resumes get rejected simply due to small mistakes or oversights. Here are some tips to help ensure your resume doesn't get rejected:

# Tailor your resume for the position

Tailoring your resume to the specific position you are applying for can make a big difference. Use keywords that match the job description. Keep 3â€“4 dedicated sets of resumes for different job profiles.

# Be concise

Employers are often short on time and want to avoid wading through pages and pages of information. Make sure the content on your resume is updated and relevant, and limit it to one or two pages.

# Highlight your accomplishments

Potential employers are interested in what you can do for them, so emphasize and quantify your achievements wherever feasible.

# Be honest and accurate

While it may be tempting to exaggerate your skills and experience, your resume must be honest and accurate. Providing false information could harm your chances of getting the job and your professional reputation.

# Resume scoring websites

Several websites offer resume-scoring services. Some of these sites include Resume-Check, Resume Scorecard, and Jobscan. These websites often analyse resumes for keywords and qualifications and offer suggestions on how well the resume meets the job criteria.

# Proofread

Before sending it out, proofread your resume for any grammatical errors, typos, and formatting issues. Have someone else read it for another view.

You can even ask people in your field on LinkedIn to review your resume. A review by a hiring manager, HR representative, or professional recruitment agency would be the best way to score your resume. This way, it will be reviewed by someone who knows the job requirements and can give you feedback on how well your resume aligns with them.

# Use a professional file format

Save your resume in a commonly used format, like PDF, so potential employers can open it quickly and read it on any device.

# Include your projects and experience

Technical resumes should include a detailed list of projects you have worked on, along with your role and specific contributions to the project. Be sure to include the technologies and tools used, as well as the results of the project.

# Showcase your problem-solving skills

Because technical tasks frequently include tackling complicated problems, emphasize your problem-solving abilities and provide concrete examples of how you have used them in previous roles.

# Keep it up-to-date

Technology is constantly evolving, so it's essential to keep your skills and experience up-to-date. Make sure your resume reflects your most current skills and experience.
