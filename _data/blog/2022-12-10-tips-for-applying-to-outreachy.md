**1. Choose your project wisely**. This is an important step, so take your time to figure out the project you are most comfortable with and then start contributing to it. Most projects are listed before the application procedure actually opens.

​**2. Contact your mentors.**If you are stuck somewhere, don’t hesitate to seek help from your mentors or other people in the project community through the mentioned communication channel.

**3. Contribute. Contribute. Contribute.** This is the most important part of your application as only applicants that make at least one contribution are eligible to be accepted as an intern. The strongest applicants make multiple contributions throughout the application process, including after the application deadline.

**4. Take time to draft your proposal.** Have a look at previously accepted proposals and draft your proposal accordingly. Update it as you make contributions. Ask for feedback on your proposal draft from your mentors. Sometimes, an organization requires you to submit a proposal to them apart from the one you are already submitting through the Outreachy dashboard. Make sure you submit at both the places.

**5. Start early.** Don’t wait until the last week to start your application. You can save your application and update it along the way. Apart from the project, you should know about your fellow applicants. If you feel that there are already a lot of strong applicants in that project, I’ll advise to move to another project. That’s why I will suggest to start contributing early and have a better understanding of the codebase of the project you wish to apply to.

**6. Don’t lose hope.** If you don’t get selected, don’t give up. If someone doesn’t respond to your query, don’t give up. Outreachy takes place twice a year! Goodluck :)
