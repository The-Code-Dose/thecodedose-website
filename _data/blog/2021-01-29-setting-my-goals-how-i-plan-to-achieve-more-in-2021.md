I recently saw [this video by Lenks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTEQw9tFTzo) where she shared her goals setting process. I was inspired by it to use a similar system to set my own goals for 2021. Keep on reading to find out how I plan to achieve more in 2021!  

#### Notion and Kanban Boards

I use Notion for basically anything and everything - from shopping lists to expense tracking and as well as travel planning. Naturally, the best place for me to set and track my goals was Notion. 

*Confession:* I love Kanban Boards.

> A *kanban board* is a visual way to manage tasks and workflows, which utilizes an analog or digital board with columns and cards. 

They look something like this in Notion-

## Setting Yearly Goals

I first wrote down everything I wanted to do and achieve in 2021. At this point in time, I was just brainstorming.

Next, I started filtering and reviewing these ideas into more concrete goals. I reflected if I had taken too much or too little and edit accordingly. After finalizing the list of things I wanted to do, it was time to transform these into measurable goals.

##### *What do I mean by measurable goals?*

For example, one of my goals is to continue my habit of reading. Last year I was able to finish my goal of 20 books. This year, I set my reading goal to 24 books which automatically becomes more measurable than just "reading more". 

I have also taken the [Goodreads reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11650-2021-reading-challenge) since I feel like tracking my progress at multiple places (especially publically) makes me more accountable. Similarly, I maintain [a thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/urvaxhi/status/1319306928166596608) where I document my progress while learning the Korean language.

## Setting Quarterly Goals

Setting my quarterly goals reminded me of setting my OKRs at my job. If I am following this system at my workspace, why not bring it to my personal life as well? 

For setting my quarterly goals, I divided my yearly goals equally into the different quarters. So, if I want to read 24 books in a year, it means I want to read 6 books every quarter. The point of dividing goals is to make tracking and reviewing the progress easier as well as to have multiple chances to reset if needed!

## Setting Monthly Goals: One month at a time

I didn't set goals for every month but rather for only the upcoming ones. This is because I don't wish to over plan since life happens and things change constantly and I don't want to end up with outdated goals that no longer interest me. 

This way, I get time to review and reflect on the past month as well as pivot in the next month if I feel like. 

## Let's talk about Weekly Goals

Similarly, I only set goals for the upcoming week using the monthly goals as the basis. I don't finish all my goals every week or most weeks even. It's fine as long as I am making progress.

## Daily Goals: Yes, No, Maybe?

I used to create daily goals but not anymore. Nowadays, I just follow up with my weekly goals that help me know the tasks for the day. But you can create yours if you wish to. I sometimes use the Momentum Chrome extension for a quick-to-access to-do list on days where I have a lot to do.

## Free Notion Template

I have created a Notion template for you to set your own goals! Check it out using [this link.](https://www.notion.so/2021-9c7e2e0a5aa140bb9bcb9650df02deea)
