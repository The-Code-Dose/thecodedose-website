    Thank you so much for the Git and GitHub workshop you conducted previously.
    I also shared this valuable knowledge with a senior developer in my company, and she also found it to be a great way to save time and increase efficiency during code merging. I truly appreciate all the help and guidance you provided during the workshop. Thank you once again!`,

    This course has been the journey I've always longed for.
    I've been gaining valuable knowledge from Urvashi's well-crafted materials and interactive sessions where I could ask any question without hesitation.
    What I appreciate the most is learning by building projects, which I love, and the specific exercises that provide exactly what I need to learn.
    From improving my basics to stepping into the world of open source with Urvashi's patient support, and I can't wait to dive into the exciting journey ahead, exploring, creating and learning along the way.`,

    It was one of the best learning experiences I had, at React Developer Program, right from start to end.
    At start: Urvashi provided us with some great resources for basic of web dev before the program started.
    During the program : Urvashi has divided the section into smaller subsections and layed out the program for each week and month beforehand, giving ample amount of time to each topic. The program is based on application based learning with less theory followed by good amount of practice projects and practical way of finding solutions.
    Environment: Over all environment  is very friendly with Daily check-ins,motivational messages and project review. The best thing about the program is that the batches are very small which leads to Urvashi giving attention to each and every student. You can contact her anytime and clear your doubts through weekly calls or direct messages.
    Outcome:I was able to make websites on my own and did gave me confidence on my skills,
    "Overall I am very happy and recommend others to join the React developer program"`,

    The major reason I took this program was not just learning React but the experience that Urvashi has and that has helped me a lot.
    The content is crisp and the exercises and projects make you think, but the code reviews you get after is the real deal.
    I personally feel quite confident in my abilities, have greater understanding of how things work, also learned a lot about open source, found new interests in technical writing after having completed 2 months of the program.
    So you can apply for this program if you're interested in React but also want some guidance, doubt-solving and reviews.
    Quite honestly the money is for the experience ,reviews, and doubt-solving because you can learn React freely too.
    Also if you're experienced I reckon this might not be for you but for a beginner it definitely is worth it.`,

    I took Urvashi's course to learn web development since I had interest in it and I do not regret a single bit. I personally am a slow learner, it takes time for me to master the basics but I believe in mastering the basics first. While some students were a little more experienced than me and I went a bit slow, Urvashi was always fair to everyone and supported me throughout my learning journey no matter how much I knew about web dev. I can say this with 100% confidence that everyone should have a mentor like Urvashi in their life.
    About the course and it's content, I love how her content is high quality yet not long comprehensive tutorials. It is broken down into bits and every concept is explained in such a simple manner that even a 13 year old can learn how to code with her videos. And it does not end with just videos, she always shares us very informative and important videos/articles to keep us knowledgeable and up-to-date about our field/industry.
    She truly fulfilled everything she promised to do in the course description.  Whenever I have doubts or I'm stuck, she is just one discord message away and that is honestly the best part about this course. I truly am grateful to have enrolled in this course, but specially to have Urvashi as a mentor. Thanks Urvashi!`,
