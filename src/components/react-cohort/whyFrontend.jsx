          We know there are courses out there that claim to teach you full stack
          web development within 4 to 6 months but we donâ€™t believe this is
          possible (at least for the 99% people out there).

        <br />
        <p>
          As a beginner, it sounds very attractive to "learn full stack web
          development in 4 months without any prior coding experience". This is
          a recipe for disaster.

          Youâ€™ll just scratch the surface and most probably end up very confused
          about everything. Superficial knowledge will lead to holes in your
          understanding. Unable to build anything from scratch because all you
          did was to copy paste projects without understanding why it works.
          This course requires you already know coding, even if that means our
          market is reduced. Know ins and outs of React and frontend. Teach
          yourself programming in 10 years
